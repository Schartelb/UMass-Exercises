Part One:
  1. Hyper Text Transfer Protocol
  //governs how clients get data from or send data to, a server
  
  2. Universal Resource Locators
  //an address for some internet resource
    
  3. Domain Nmae System
  //system that converts human-readable URLS and converts them into IP addresses
  
  4. Any part of the URL after the resource portion, providing extra info to server
  //allows you to pass key-value pairs into the URL, in the format "?key1=value1&key2..."
    
  5. GET- Gets data from server (no change to data on the server)
     POST - send some data to the server(pages change data on server)
  
 
 6. Request - calls for information to load webpage
  7. Response - answers response with information to load
  8. Parts of requests and responses that communicate expectations for data
    date of browser/server
    cache information
    language to load in
  9. Contacts DNS Server finds URL, sends request, receives responses to requests, asynchronously loads page
  // 
// Your browser “resolves” the name into an IP address using DNS
// Your browser makes a request to that IP address, including headers (info about browser, any previous cookies, and other things)
// The server sends a response (typically, HTML, with a status code (200 if it was sucessful)
// The browser makes a DOM from that HTML, and finds any other resources needed (images, CSS, JavaScript, etc)
// The browser makes separate HTTP requests for those resources and receives response from the server for each
