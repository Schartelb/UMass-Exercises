//1. var may be reassigned, redeclared: let may not be redeclared. **hoisted variables accessible with var.  Let uses block scope**
//2. var may be reassigned, redeclared: const may not be either. **hoisted variables accessible with var.  const uses block scope**
//3. let may be reassigned: const may not. 
//4. variables are initialized at the beginning of the code.  Only happens with var.

// **It’s the way that we explain how the JS compiler works. Variables are lifting or “hoisted” to the top of the scope they are declared in. When using var, you can access the variable name and it’s undefined value before it is used later on.
// Function declarations are also hoisted and can be invoked “before” they are defined in a codebase.**
